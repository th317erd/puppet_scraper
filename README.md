# puppet_scraper

Web scraper service using headless Puppeteer

I wrote this at the beginning of 2022 as a proof of concept (just now getting around to uploading it to GIT). It is functional (though its Mythix dependencies are very outdated at this point).

This uses the headless Puppeteer chromium browser to load and scrape websites.
